## 4. CLAUDE.md Gateway Template

Copy this into `CLAUDE.md` at project root. Adjust token thresholds to match your model's context window.

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md — Agent Gateway Rules

> Read first. Hard constraints.

## Boot (3 tool calls max)
```
[B1] Bash: (cs_dt=$(grep "^dt=" .sessions/compact_state.md 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1); today=$(date +%Y-%m-%d); compact_restore=false; [ "$cs_dt" = "$today" ] && compact_restore=true && echo "[compact-restore]" && cat .sessions/compact_state.md && echo "---"; phase=$(grep "^phase:" .sessions/active_thread.md 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $2}'); { [ "$compact_restore" = "true" ] || [ "$phase" != "in_progress" ]; } && printf "SESSION_TOTAL: 0\nCHAT_TOTAL: 7300\n" > .sessions/session_tokens.md; cat .sessions/active_thread.md 2>/dev/null | tail -4; echo "---"; cat .sessions/session_tokens.md 2>/dev/null; echo "---"; grep -n "\[/\]" docs/master_roadmap.md 2>/dev/null | head -3; echo "---"; echo "CFP_COUNT: $(grep -c '^## CFP-' CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0)")
[B2] IF [compact-restore] in B1 output → parse sk= from compact_state.md → use as skill_name · SKIP manifest read (~1,300 tokens saved)
     ELSE IF prompt contains `skill: <name>` → skip manifest read · ELSE: grep keywords[] from skill-manifest.json (not full read) → identify skill_name
[B3] IF [compact-restore]: sha1 check sk_h= + mece_h= → hash match → SKIP SKILL.md + mece/SKILL.md reads (~2.9k tokens saved total)
     ELSE: Read .agents/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md offset=1 limit=80 → sections[] only · on_demand_files = lookup table for G2 (NOT loaded at boot)
           Also: Read .agents/skills/mece/SKILL.md offset=31 limit=110 → §Plan Format + §Execution Protocol into working memory
```
→ B1 resets SESSION_TOTAL=0 · sets CHAT_TOTAL=7300 (system_fixed) on compact-restore OR phase≠in_progress
→ Load SESSION_TOTAL + CHAT_TOTAL from B1 into working memory (both sourced from session_tokens.md)
→ Load CFP_COUNT from B1 output → store as `cfp_boot_count` in working memory (used by self_improve)
→ If SESSION_TOTAL > 60k → warn user immediately before proceeding

[B4] Platform Probe (run only if `.agents/platform/detected.md` has `platform: unknown`):
     → List available tools → match against known platforms (see 07_platform.md Known Mappings)
     → Found match → update detected.md → proceed
     → No match → emit [platform-unknown] → ask 4 co-development questions (see 07_platform.md)
     → B4 is skipped if detected.md already has a known platform value

Reply line 1 — Boot trace:
```
**[Boot]** Thread: <done|in_progress> · Tasks: <N open> · Skill: `<name>` · Sections: <N> · Tokens: ~<N>k · CFP: <cfp_boot_count>
```

## ⚡ MANDATORY BOOT GATE

**Before responding to ANY user message — verify `[Boot]` trace has been emitted this session.**

If `[Boot]` trace has NOT been emitted yet:
1. STOP — do not respond to the user message
2. Run B1 → B2 → B3 (Boot Sequence above, max 3 tool calls)
3. Emit: `**[Boot]** Thread: ... · Skill: ... · Tokens: ~Nk · CFP: N`
4. THEN respond to the user

**Skipping boot = invalid session state. Responding without `[Boot]` = harness violation (CFP).**

---

## R1 · Token Tracking
Two counters — both in working memory, sourced from files at Boot:
- `SESSION_TOTAL` — resets at session close (per-task cost) · file: `.sessions/session_tokens.md`
- `CHAT_TOTAL` — resets only on /compact or new chat (true context window size) · file: `.sessions/session_tokens.md` (same file as SESSION_TOTAL) · B1 re-initializes to 7300 (system_fixed) on reset

Formulas:
- Output = (thai_chars × 1.7) + (en_chars × 0.3)
- Input = (user_msg_chars × 0.3) + context_overhead + tool_result_tokens
- context_overhead: Turn 1 = ~8,000 | Turn N = 800 + (CHAT_TOTAL × 0.6)
- Tool results: classify by file type — `.md`/`.txt` → split formula; `.ts`/`.js`/`.json` → `× 0.3`; Bash → check for Thai

Each turn: add turn_tokens → SESSION_TOTAL AND CHAT_TOTAL.
Write SESSION_TOTAL at: token pause · blocked halt · completion gate.
Write CHAT_TOTAL at: /compact (reset→0, then B1 re-initializes to 7300 on next boot) · session close (accumulate).
Footer every response: `*(Session: ~NNNk | Chat: ~NNNk tokens)*`
- ⚠️ Do not define token formulas in other skill files — use R1 values exclusively

### Tool Result Tokens (tiered — applied per result before adding to SESSION_TOTAL)

| Result size | Formula | Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 150 lines | `result_chars × 0.3` | 200 tokens |
| 151–300 lines | `result_chars × 0.5` | 200 tokens |
| > 300 lines | `result_chars × 0.5 + 1,000 flat buffer` | 200 tokens |

Never use UTF-8 bytes ÷ 3 — undercounts Thai by up to 1.7×.

---

## R2 · Tool Budget
Max 5 tool calls/turn. Retry max 2×; diagnose on 2nd fail.

---

## Per-Turn Routing (every user message — before any work)

Run C0 → C1 → C2 → C3 before any work. Topic switch = close current session FIRST.

**C0 — Complaint Check:**
- Detect signals: "ทำไมไม่ทำตาม" · "you skipped" · "ลืม" + harness step · "harness says" + violation
- "ลืม" qualifier: object MUST be a harness step name (roadmap/error_index/CFP/index/boot/skill/gate/MECE)
  "ลืมบอกให้เพิ่ม filter" = feature request → NOT C0
- c0_resolved flag set in working memory → clear flag → skip C0 → proceed to C1 (prevents loop)
- YES → emit [self-improve] → backfill missed step (ask if context gone) → log CFP → set c0_resolved=true → re-run C0-C3
- NO → C1

**C1 — Load state:** Read `.sessions/active_thread.md` → extract current task

**C2 — Topic Switch + Task Freshness Check:**
IS a switch (close session first):
  · Different app section · Different primary entity · Different intent type (debug→feature)
  · Message names a different route/module than current task
NOT a switch:
  · "also fix/update" · revision of approach · bug inside current work · "ต่อ/continue"
UNCERTAIN → emit [topic-unclear] → ASK before routing

Same topic detected → task-freshness check:
  `grep "status:\|^\- \[ \]\|^\- \[/\]" .sessions/mece_plan.md | head -3`
  status:task-complete OR task-mismatch OR no pending [ ]/[/] → NEW TASK (force Phase 1+2 · skip Phase 0 if same chat)
  pending [ ] or [/] found + task matches → resume Phase 3

**C3 — Route:**
- Topic switch → emit [topic-switch] Current: X · New: Y → session_manager close
  → check provider (`grep "^platform:" detected.md`):
    claude-code → /compact → Phase 1 fresh same chat
    other       → compact_state.md → "เปิด chat ใหม่ได้เลยครับ" → STOP
- Same topic → match keywords → re-read SKILL.md if skill changes

Routing shortcuts:
  "แก้ bug / fix / error"       → editor
  "สร้าง / implement / เพิ่ม"   → coder
  "ปิด / close / done"           → session_manager
  "plan / วางแผน"                → mece
  "review CFP / improve harness" → self_improve
  no match                       → agent (fallback)

---

## R3 · Session Pause
| Counter | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| SESSION_TOTAL | >50k | **MID-SESSION COMPACT** — non-blocking, continue work after compact |
| SESSION_TOTAL | >60k | finish current loop step → TOKEN PAUSE |
| SESSION_TOTAL | >90k | HALT immediately → save state → report to user |
| CHAT_TOTAL | >120k | ⚠️ recommend /compact — context window หนัก |
| CHAT_TOTAL | >180k | 🛑 /compact บังคับ ก่อนรับงานใหม่ |

**Mid-Session Compact (>50k) — runs without interrupting work:**
```
1. Write .sessions/context_compact_<N>.md:
   summary:    <what was done so far — key decisions, artifacts, state> (≤300 tokens)
   keep_loops: <last 6 loop interactions verbatim>
   compacted:  <everything older than last 6 loops → summarized into `summary` field above>
2. Emit [compact] Context: ~<N>k → compacted · keeping last 6 loops
3. Treat `summary` as the new context anchor — do NOT re-read old tool results
4. Continue current task from where it left off (no TOKEN PAUSE, no user prompt)
```
Compact fires once per 10k window — next compact at SESSION_TOTAL > 60k if still running (before TOKEN PAUSE check).

---

## R4 · Sub-agent Decision
Run 1 Bash scope probe before any task.

**Spawn patterns (3 types):**

| Pattern | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Explore** | scope ≥ 5 files / ≥ 300 lines | `invoke_subagent` (TypeName: `"research"`) → summary ≤500 tokens → act on summary only |
| **Execution** | single section > 8 steps + isolated output | `invoke_subagent` (TypeName: `"self"`) → pass goal + constraints + output format → receive structured result |
| **Parallel fan-out** | ≥ 2 sections in same Cycle (no dependency) | `invoke_subagent` Subagents[...] (one per section) → each writes `.sessions/cycle_N_<section_id>.json` → read all results → pass as context to next Cycle → single Completion Gate after all Cycles |

**Hard limits:**
- Max depth: 1 level only — worker agents may NOT spawn further agents
- Sub-agent output: structured (JSON or table) — never prose
- Token budget: sub-agent tokens count toward SESSION_TOTAL (no separate budget)
- Parallel spawn: pass all sections as array in single `invoke_subagents` Subagents[] (not sequentially)
- Custom types: use `define_subagent` to register a new TypeName for the session before invoking

**Harness Context in Sub-agent Prompts:**
- Explore agents (read-only): no harness constraints needed
- Execution/Coder agents (any src/ work): MUST include `constraints:` block:
  ```
  constraints:
    - Roadmap: task T-<N> must be [/] before any edit — grep docs/master_roadmap.md first
    - No src/ edit without gather_complete.md AND mece_plan.md written today
    - No new file without updating knowledge/index_files.json backlinks
    - No symbol create/rename without python scripts/symbol_indexer.py after edit
    - DB edits (src/db/): emit [db-gate] and halt — main agent must confirm
  ```
- Missing `constraints:` block in execution sub-agent prompt = CFP violation

**Multi-file relevance check — primary vs fallback:**

**Primary (spawn available):** Reading > 2 files to assess relevance → spawn Explore sub-agent instead.
- Prompt: file list + "return verdict per file: relevant | partial | irrelevant + excerpt if partial"
- Act on summary only — never inject sub-agent's full read results into main context
- Irrelevant content stays isolated in sub-agent context, not main history

**Fallback (spawn NOT available — platform-unknown, max depth = 1, or spawn error):**
Main agent must read directly — apply strict protocol:
1. Read one file at a time — Pre-Read Gate (T1/T2/T3) mandatory, no exceptions
2. Emit `[post-read]` verdict immediately after each read
3. Verdict `irrelevant` → stop reading that file — do NOT read further sections
4. Every 3 reads: compress relevant findings to ≤200 chars in working memory → release individual read results from active tracking
5. Hard cap: max 5 direct reads per relevance batch — if still unresolved → emit `[read-cap]` → ask user: "ช่วยบอกว่าข้อมูลที่ต้องการอยู่ที่ไฟล์ไหนครับ?"

---

## R5 · Index-First Lookup

**Pre-Read Gate — emit BEFORE every Read call:**
```
**[pre-read]** Target: `<symbol>` · Tier: T<1|2|3> · Line: <N> · Will read: offset=<N> limit=60
```
Cannot fill Line? → grep not done yet → run grep first.

**Post-Read Verdict — emit AFTER every Read result is processed:**

**[post-read]** Target: `<file>` · Verdict: `relevant | partial | irrelevant` · Action: `keep | excerpt(L<N>–L<N>) | drop`
- `relevant` → include as-is in `on_demand_files:` or `cycle_context:`
- `partial` → include only the stated excerpt range — not the full file
- `irrelevant` → drop immediately; do NOT include in `on_demand_files:`, `cycle_context:`, or any sub-agent prompt
- Failure to emit `[post-read]` = treat content as `irrelevant` → drop
- See CFP-004 in CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md

**Pre-Edit Gate — emit BEFORE every Edit/Write on a named symbol:**
```
**[pre-edit]** Symbol: `<name>` · index_variables lookup: T1 done · used_in: <N files> · safe to edit: <yes|needs review>
```
→ `grep -A 8 '"SymbolName"' knowledge/index_variables.json` → check `used_in` → review all dependents

**Lookup tiers (stop at first that yields line number):**
- T1: `grep -A 8 '"Symbol"' knowledge/index_variables.json` or `index_files.json`
- T2: `grep -B 2 -A 20 '"Symbol"' knowledge/index_variables.json`
- T3: `grep -n "Symbol" src/path/to/file.ts`

T1 partial match (path found but no line number) → proceed to T2. Still no line? → T3.

**Config files load ONCE at Boot (B1–B3) — never re-read mid-session:**
CLAUDE.md · index_files.json · index_variables.json → in working memory after Boot.
Re-read only after TOKEN PAUSE + resume.

| Prohibited | Required instead |
|---|---|
| Read without offset+limit | grep first → get line N → Read offset=N-5 limit=60 |
| Read >60 lines per call | Split into multiple targeted reads |
| Read knowledge/*.json in full | grep specific key only |
| Re-read CLAUDE.md mid-session | Already in working memory |

---

## R6 · Output Filter
Pipe all Bash: `cmd 2>&1 | grep -iE "error|warn|fail" | tail -20`

---

## R7 · Response Density
Default: table/bullet over prose. Comparison → table. Steps → numbered list.

---

## R8 · Index Sync (MANDATORY after every file change)
| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| Create/delete/move file | Update knowledge/index_files.json + backlinks |
| Edit file (add/remove imports) | Update backlinks in knowledge/index_files.json |
| Create/delete/rename symbol | Update knowledge/index_variables.json + run python scripts/symbol_indexer.py |

---

## R9 · Error Protocol
⚠️ MANDATORY 3-step check before any debug:
1. grep knowledge/error_index.md for symptom keyword
2. grep knowledge/index_variables.json for affected symbol
3. grep knowledge/index_files.json for backlinks

**Step 0 — Recurring Fix Detection (run FIRST):**
Signals: "ยังไม่หาย" · "แก้แล้วยัง" · "still broken" · "same error" · "กลับมาอีก" · "fix ไม่ผ่าน" · "ยังเจออยู่" · "ยังเป็นอยู่"
OR: same ERR-XXX already [X] in roadmap / same T-N-BugID referenced
→ Recurring: grep roadmap for prior AttemptID → read `### Failed Approaches:` in error_index entry → choose DIFFERENT approach
→ Emit: `[recurring] ERR-XXX · Prior attempts: N · Previous approach: <summary> · New approach: <what's different>`

New error → Task ID format: `T-{ParentTask}-{BugID}-{AttemptID}` (e.g. `T-004-001-02`)
1. Add `[ ] T-{N}-{BugID}-01: <description>` to roadmap → set `[/]`
2. Fix code
3. Run python scripts/symbol_indexer.py
4. Assign ERR-XXX code
5. Write entry in knowledge/error_index.md (include Task ID + cross-link + `### Failed Approaches:` field)
6. Mark roadmap `[X] T-{N}-{BugID}-{Attempt} (→ ERR-XXX)`

**On R12 verify failure** — before escalating per R13, MUST write to error_index entry:
```
### Failed Approaches:
- [YYYY-MM-DD] T-{N}-{BugID}-01: <approach tried> → verify failed · Reason: <why it didn't resolve>
```

---

## R10–R11 · Tool Cap + English
R10: Truncate all tool results at 300 lines. >300 → grep relevant section only.
R11: `.sessions/`, `knowledge/`, comments, commits → English only. Thai: user replies only.

---

## R12 · Post-Edit Verification

| Action | Verify |
|---|---|
| Edit `src/` | Re-read changed section · check no broken imports |
| DB schema | No ERR-007 violations |
| Create/delete file | `index_files.json` updated + backlinks resolved |
| Error fix | ERR-XXX in error_index.md + roadmap `[X]` |

---

## R13 · Escalation
AttemptID=02 / tool error 2× / R12 FAIL twice → emit and halt:
```
[blocked] Task: `<T-ID>` · Attempts: 2 · Cause: <root cause> · Need: <missing>
```

---

## R14 · Destructive Action Gates
Emit `[gate]` + wait confirm before: delete/overwrite `src/` or `knowledge/` · any `src/db/` edit · batch >5 files.
```
[gate] Action: `<what>` · Scope: `<files>` · Risk: `<why>` · Waiting: confirm
```

---

## R15 · DB Hard Stop
Any `src/db/` edit or TS type with DB columns → HALT immediately:
```
[db-gate] File: `<path>` · Symbol: `<name>` · Change: `<what>` · DB impact: `<tables>` · → Waiting for explicit "yes"
```
Do NOT proceed until user says "yes" explicitly.

---

## Never-Full-Load (hard — no exceptions)

These files must NEVER be fully read — grep or targeted offset+limit only:

```
CLAUDE.md                      → NEVER re-read (in context at boot)
knowledge/index_variables.json → grep ONLY · NEVER Read full
knowledge/index_files.json     → grep ONLY · NEVER Read full
CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md     → grep -c + Read offset=N limit=30 per entry ONLY
docs/master_roadmap.md         → grep -n or tail -30 · NEVER full Read
INVARIANTS.md                  → on-demand when R14/R15 gate fires ONLY
knowledge/error_index.md       → grep → Read ≤40L ONLY
knowledge/index_cfp_fix.json   → full ok ≤30 entries · grep ONLY beyond 30
```

Full-Read permitted: `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` (≤80L) · `src/` ≤80L G2 only · `.sessions/active_thread.md` · `.sessions/session_handoff.md` · `.sessions/compact_state.md` · `REPO_MAP.md`

Violation → emit `[violation] never-full-load` → discard → re-run as grep.

---

## R-Roadmap · All work must be logged
Before starting ANY task:
- New feature: `[ ] T-<N>: description`
- Bug fix: `[ ] T-{Parent}-{BugID}-{AttemptID}: description`
- Sub-task: `- [ ] T-<N>.{sub}: description`

Set `[/]` when starting → `[X]` when done.
---

## R16 · Self-Improvement Protocol (User Complaint Detection)

**Detection — treat as harness complaint if user message contains ANY of:**
- "ทำไมไม่ทำตาม" / "ไม่ได้ทำตาม" + harness context
- "ลืม" + harness step name (roadmap/error_index/CFP/index/pre-read/boot/skill/gate/MECE) — NOT feature/component name
- "ไม่ได้บันทึก" / "ไม่ได้ log" / "ไม่ได้ update" + (roadmap|error_index|index|CFP)
- "why didn't you follow" / "you skipped" / "you forgot" + rule/step reference
- "harness says" / "CLAUDE.md says" / "rule says" + implied violation
- Any correction where user explicitly names a harness step that was supposed to run

**On detection — run this sequence immediately (before resuming original task):**
```
[C0] COMPLAINT DETECTED
  1. Emit: [self-improve] Rule violated: `<R-number>` · Missed: `<what was skipped>`
  2. DO NOT argue, explain away, or justify the skip
  3. Execute the missed step NOW (context gone → ask user for missing info first → wait)
  4. Verify missed step completed → emit [✓ backfilled] `<what was done>`
  5. Log CFP (procedure below)
  6. Set c0_resolved = true → re-run C0→C1→C2→C3 with original user message
     (C0 detects c0_resolved → clears it → skips complaint check → proceeds to C1)
```

**CFP Logging Procedure:**
```
Step 1: grep -c "^## CFP-" CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md → get count N → next = CFP-(N+1)
Step 2: Append to CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md:

## CFP-<N+1> · <Short Title of What Was Skipped>

**Symptom:** <What the user observed — what was missing>
**Root cause:**
- <Why agent skipped this step>
- <Which rule/phase was violated>
**Prevention:**
1. <Specific check to prevent recurrence>
2. <Where in the loop this check should live>
**Detection signal:** User message contains `<C0 keyword>` + <step name>

---

Step 2.5: Validate "Detection signal:" field
  Must contain ≥1 keyword from C0 signal list
  Keyword absent/vague → rewrite with matching keyword → then proceed
Step 3: Verify: grep -c "^## CFP-" CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md → N+1
```

**Hard rules:**
- Never skip CFP logging even if the fix is trivial
- Never re-use an existing CFP number — always increment
- Same pattern recurs → new CFP with `(recurrence of CFP-N)` note

```

## 11. AGENTS.md Template (Generic Harness)

Copy this file verbatim to `AGENTS.md` at project root.
Fill in `[PROJECT NAME]` and add project-specific rules in the placeholder at the bottom.

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN:agent-orientation -->
# Agent Orientation — Read Before Acting

You are operating inside the **[PROJECT NAME]** project. Rules apply to ALL agents regardless of vendor.

> **Full hard constraints → `CLAUDE.md` (You MUST read this file first and strictly follow all of its principles)** · **Destructive gates → `INVARIANTS.md`** · **Repo structure → `REPO_MAP.md`**

## Boot Sequence (3 tool calls max)

```
[B1] Bash: (cs_dt=$(grep "^dt=" .sessions/compact_state.md 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1); today=$(date +%Y-%m-%d); compact_restore=false; [ "$cs_dt" = "$today" ] && compact_restore=true && echo "[compact-restore]" && cat .sessions/compact_state.md && echo "---"; phase=$(grep "^phase:" .sessions/active_thread.md 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $2}'); { [ "$compact_restore" = "true" ] || [ "$phase" != "in_progress" ]; } && printf "SESSION_TOTAL: 0\nCHAT_TOTAL: 7300\n" > .sessions/session_tokens.md; cat .sessions/active_thread.md 2>/dev/null | tail -4; echo "---"; cat .sessions/session_tokens.md 2>/dev/null; echo "---"; grep -n "\[/\]" docs/master_roadmap.md 2>/dev/null | head -3; echo "---"; echo "CFP_COUNT: $(grep -c '^## CFP-' CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0)")
[B2] IF [compact-restore] in B1 output → parse sk= from compact_state.md → use as skill_name · SKIP manifest read (~1,300 tokens saved)
     ELSE IF prompt contains `skill: <name>` → skip manifest read · ELSE: grep keywords[] from skill-manifest.json (not full read) → identify skill_name
[B3] IF [compact-restore]: sha1 check sk_h= + mece_h= → hash match → SKIP SKILL.md + mece/SKILL.md reads (~2.9k tokens saved total)
     ELSE: Read .agents/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md offset=1 limit=80 → sections[] only · on_demand_files = lookup table for G2 (NOT loaded at boot)
           Also: Read .agents/skills/mece/SKILL.md offset=31 limit=110 → §Plan Format + §Execution Protocol into working memory
```

[B4] Platform Probe (run only if `.agents/platform/detected.md` has `platform: unknown`):
     → List available tools → match against known platforms (see detected.md Known Platform Mappings)
     → Found match → update detected.md → proceed
     → No match → emit [platform-unknown] → ask 4 co-development questions (see 07_platform.md)
     → B4 is skipped if detected.md already has a known platform value

- B1 auto-resets SESSION_TOTAL to 0 when phase ≠ in_progress (preserves in-progress sessions)
- Load CFP_COUNT from B1 output → store as `cfp_boot_count` in working memory (used by self_improve)
- If SESSION_TOTAL > 60k → warn user before proceeding

Reply line 1: `**[Boot]** Thread: <done|in_progress> · Tasks: <N open> · Skill: <name> · Sections: <N> · Tokens: ~<N>k · CFP: <cfp_boot_count>`

> ⚠️ **Boot ending ≠ ready to work.** After Reply line 1 → run C0–C3 → then Phase 1.
> Reading SKILL.md at B3 is NOT Phase 1. Do NOT touch `src/` until `[✓ gather]` AND `[✓ MECE]` emitted.

---

## Per-Turn Routing (every user message — run C0→C1→C2→C3 before any work)

**Hard rule:** Agent detects topic switch autonomously — user must NOT need to say "close session".

**C0 — Complaint Check:**
- Signals: "ทำไมไม่ทำตาม" · "ไม่ได้บันทึก" · "you skipped" · "ลืม" + harness step · "harness says" + violation
- "ลืม" qualifier: object must be a harness step name (roadmap/error_index/CFP/index/boot/skill/gate/MECE)
  "ลืมบอกให้เพิ่ม X" = feature request → NOT C0
- c0_resolved flag set → clear → skip C0 → proceed to C1 (prevents infinite C0 loop)
- YES → [self-improve] → backfill → CFP log → c0_resolved=true → re-run C0-C3
- NO → C1

**C1 — Load:** Read `.sessions/active_thread.md` → extract task: field

**C2 — Topic Switch Check:**
IS a switch (close first):
  · Different app section (site-plan ↔ center ↔ admin ↔ report)
  · Different primary entity (job ↔ user ↔ plan ↔ request)
  · Different intent type (debug→feature or feature→debug)
  · Message names different route/module than current task
NOT a switch:
  · "also fix/update" · revision of approach · added constraint
  · Bug inside current work · "ต่อ/continue/keep going"
UNCERTAIN → emit [topic-unclear] → ASK before routing

**C3 — Route:**
Topic switch → emit [topic-switch] Current: X · New: Y · Closing first
             → session_manager §3 (close + reset) → new Phase 1
Same topic   → match keywords[] → re-read SKILL.md if skill changes

> ⚠️ **After C3 (any branch) → MANDATORY: Phase 1 G1-G2-G3 next. No exceptions.**
> Knowing the skill (B3) does NOT satisfy Phase 1. Must grep indexes + read files + emit `[✓ gather]`.
> `[✓ gather]` MUST write `.sessions/gather_complete.md` with `date: YYYY-MM-DD`.
> Then Phase 2: MECE plan → user confirm → write `mece_plan.md` → emit `[✓ MECE]`.
> **PreToolUse hook blocks `src/` Edit if `gather_complete.md` or `mece_plan.md` missing or stale (not written today).**

| 1 Info Gather | **Hybrid front-loaded:** G1 scans ALL sections at once → output missing_files[] + missing_user_input[] · G2 runs ALL greps in one Bash call → targeted Read per item · Single user ask (max 1 per Phase 1 run) if input still missing → emit [✓ gather] |
| 2 MECE Plan | Build plan (1:1 Skill sections) → Verify-N per section → user confirms → roadmap |

**[G0] Task clarity gate** — run ONCE before G1:
- Skip G0 if task has ≥3 of: specific feature name · file/path · error message · "fix/add/update X in Y"
- Otherwise → `AskUserQuestion` — **MUST include options per question (never open-ended only)**:
  - Goal: what outcome? · options = [add feature / fix bug / refactor / other]
  - Affected area: which module/file? · options = sections from REPO_MAP.md (read at G0 — in Never-Full-Load whitelist)
  - Constraints: limits? · options = [none / list specific]
  - Definition of done: acceptance test? · options = [passes tests / UI works / data correct / other]
- **Refusal contract:** user ignores ≥2 rounds → emit `[gather-refused]` · HALT (don't proceed to G1)
- **Output contract:** on spec complete → gather_complete.md must include: `objective` · `constraints` · `affected_files` · `acceptance_criteria` · `verification_intent`
- G0 runs ONCE only → if still unclear → `[gather-stalled]`

**Gather rules:**
- G1: scan ALL sections in one pass — never one section at a time
- G2: batch ALL greps into one Bash call — never one grep per turn
- User ask: combine ALL missing items into ONE message — never ask incrementally
- Stall cap: if after G1+G2+1 user ask context still insufficient → emit `[gather-stalled]` → halt Phase 1
- Spec completeness (new feature tasks): G3 must confirm all 5 fields present: goal · constraints · affected files · acceptance criteria · verification plan
- max_clarification_rounds: 5 → after 5 rounds still incomplete → `[gather-stalled]`
| 3 | Execution | Cycle Gate → group sections into Cycles → CYCLE LOOP: spawn Cycle N parallel → await → read cycle_N_*.json → spawn Cycle N+1 → Completion Gate |

**Phases 1–2 run ONCE per task. On resume: skip to Phase 3 at pending section.**

Completion Gate:
**Token Check (run first):**
- SESSION_TOTAL > 50k AND compact not yet run? → compact first → then run Completion Gate checks
- SESSION_TOTAL > 60k? → TOKEN PAUSE before Completion Gate
```
□ All sections executed  □ Writes [✓ written]  □ Index Sync
□ Roadmap [X]           □ phase: done          □ SESSION_TOTAL written → .sessions/session_tokens.md
□ Feedback & Error Summary delivered to user (see mece/SKILL.md Final Step)

## Backlink Rule

Before editing any file:
```bash
grep -A 6 '"src/path/to/file"' knowledge/index_files.json
```
Check `backlinks[]` — every file listed imports the file you are about to edit. Update all of them.

---

## Quick Reference

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Token footer | Every response: `*(Session total: ~NNN tokens)*` |
| File reads | grep index first → Read offset+limit only (never full file >60 lines) |
| Symbol edits | grep index_variables → check used_in → emit [pre-edit] |
| Destructive actions | INVARIANTS.md §I1 — emit [gate] and wait confirm |
| Error protocol | error_index → symbol_index → file_index (all 3 in order) |
| Roadmap | Every task logged before execution. `[ ]` → `[/]` → `[X]` |
| Session close | route `session_manager` — writes: `active_thread.md` · `session_tokens.md` · `session_handoff.md` · session JSON · `master_roadmap.md` → SESSION_TOTAL: 0 |
| Topic switch | New task = new session JSON — never carry raw History across tasks |

---

## Reference Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `INVARIANTS.md` | Destructive gates (I1) + hard stops (I2) |
| `REPO_MAP.md` | Directory layers, protected zones, quick lookup commands |
| `CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md` | Known agent failure modes (fill as bugs occur) |
| `knowledge/error_index.md` | ERR-XXX error log (search first before any debug) |
| `docs/master_roadmap.md` | Task checklist |

---

## Critical Project-Specific Rules

<!-- EDIT: Add hard rules specific to this project's stack.
     Examples:
     - Database constraints (no multi-row inserts, no upsert on conflict, no float in int columns)
     - Runtime constraints (no Node.js APIs in edge runtime, WebCrypto only)
     - Parsing rules (always use library X, never manual split)
     Reference INVARIANTS.md for destructive-action gates. -->
<!-- END:agent-orientation -->
```

---

## 12. INVARIANTS.md Skeleton

Copy to `INVARIANTS.md`. Fill in I2 with project-specific hard stops.

```markdown
# INVARIANTS.md — Destructive Action Gates

> Hard stops for this project. Every AI agent must check this file before any irreversible action.

---

## I1 · Destructive Action Gate

Before any of these actions → emit `[gate]` → ask user → wait for explicit "yes":

- Deleting files or directories
- Overwriting existing data (DB write, file overwrite, bulk update)
- Running `rm`, `drop`, `truncate`, `DELETE` without scoped WHERE
- `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git checkout --`

---

## I2 · DB Structure Hard Stop

**Any trigger below = HALT immediately. Do NOT touch anything until user says "yes" explicitly.**

Triggers (any one is enough):
- Edit to any file in `src/db/` (schema, migration, seed, connection, queries)
- Rename, remove, or change TypeScript type/interface that has DB column fields
- Any symbol in `index_variables.json` with type `DBTable`, `DBColumn`, or `DrizzleSchema`
- Adding/removing columns, changing column types, altering table relationships

Gate — emit and WAIT before any tool call:
```
[db-gate] File: `<path>` · Symbol: `<name>` · Change: `<what will change>`
          DB impact: `<tables/columns affected>` · Data risk: `<what could break>`
          → Waiting for explicit "yes" — NOT proceeding until confirmed
```

**"It's just a TypeScript type" is NOT an exemption.**
Drizzle derives DB schema from TypeScript types — a type rename silently breaks migrations and queries.

> ⚠️ EDIT THIS for project-specific additional rules (multi-row INSERT, edge runtime constraints, CSV parsing, etc.)
> Reference: INVARIANTS.md I2 for canonical source.

---

## I3 · Knowledge Index Sync

After any symbol create/delete/rename → MUST update both indexes before closing task:
- `knowledge/index_variables.json` — symbol entry + line numbers
- `knowledge/index_files.json` — backlinks

Run: `python scripts/symbol_indexer.py` to regenerate.

---

## I4 · Pre-Edit Symbol Check (Required)

Before editing any symbol that appears in `knowledge/index_variables.json`:
```bash
grep -A 8 '"SymbolName"' knowledge/index_variables.json   # check used_in array
```
Emit and log:
```
[pre-edit] Symbol: `<name>` · used_in: <N files> · safe to edit: <yes|needs review>
```

## I5 · Roadmap Entry Required

Every task (bug fix, feature, enhancement) must exist in `docs/master_roadmap.md` before execution.
Never duplicate task IDs. grep roadmap before creating.

---

## I6 · Pre-assign Roadmap IDs Before Parallel Spawn

When spawning parallel sub-agents — pre-assign ALL roadmap task IDs BEFORE any spawn call:
1. `grep docs/master_roadmap.md` → find last T-N
2. Write `[ ] T-N+1`, `[ ] T-N+2`, ... for ALL sections BEFORE spawning any agent
3. Pass assigned T-ID to each sub-agent in its Delegation Contract
Sub-agents MUST NOT self-assign IDs — race condition causes duplicate T-IDs.

---

## I7 · Cycle Token Accounting (tokens_estimated mandatory)

Every sub-agent result file (`.sessions/cycle_N_<id>.json`) MUST include `"tokens_estimated"` field.
After all Cycle N agents complete — orchestrator must:
1. Sum `tokens_estimated` from all `cycle_N_*.json` files
2. Missing field → add 2,000 flat (buffer)
3. Add sum to SESSION_TOTAL in working memory
4. Write updated total → `.sessions/session_tokens.md`
5. Check R3 threshold immediately after writing

---

## I8 · CFP ID Pre-assignment (Parallel Sessions)

When multiple parallel agents may log CFPs:
1. `grep -c "^## CFP-" CODING_FAILURE_PATTERNS.md` → get count N
2. Pre-assign CFP-N+1, CFP-N+2, ... before spawn
3. Pass assigned IDs to sub-agents in Delegation Contract
Sub-agents MUST NOT auto-increment without pre-assignment — causes duplicate CFP numbers.

---

## Protected Zones

<!-- EDIT: List files/directories that must NEVER be overwritten without user confirmation.
     Examples:
     - CLAUDE.md · AGENTS.md · INVARIANTS.md — system files
     - docs/master_roadmap.md — task ledger
     - knowledge/index_files.json · knowledge/index_variables.json — indexes
     - db_migrations/ — never edit manually; use migration tooling only
-->
```

---

## 13. REPO_MAP.md Skeleton

Copy to `REPO_MAP.md`. Fill in directory layout and project-specific zones.

```markdown
# REPO_MAP.md — Repository Structure & Protected Zones

---

## Directory Layout

```
<!-- EDIT: Document your project's source tree here. Example:
src/
├── app/           # Next.js app router pages
├── components/    # Shared UI components
├── lib/           # Utilities and helpers
└── db/            # Database schema and queries
-->

knowledge/         # Agent indexes — managed by agent + symbol_indexer.py
.agents/skills/    # Skill definitions
.sessions/         # Session state
docs/              # Roadmap and logs
scripts/           # Automation scripts (symbol_indexer.py)
```

---

## Protected Zones

| Path | Rule |
|---|---|
| `knowledge/` | Never delete manually — managed by agent |
| `.sessions/` | Never delete manually — session state |
| `docs/master_roadmap.md` | Edit only via agent workflow (`[ ]` → `[/]` → `[X]`) |

<!-- EDIT: Add project-specific protected zones -->

---

## Quick Lookup Commands

```bash
# Find file by name
find src/ -name "*.ts" | grep "keyword"

# Find symbol definition
grep -rn "export.*FunctionName" src/

# Check who imports a file
grep -A 6 '"src/path/to/file"' knowledge/index_files.json

# Find all usages of a symbol
grep -rl "SymbolName" src/
```

<!-- EDIT: Add project-specific module boundaries and lookup patterns -->
```

## registry.md Template

Copy to `.agents/skills/registry.md`. Human-readable fallback routing table.

```markdown
# Skill Registry — Fast Match Table

> Fallback when skill-manifest.json lookup is ambiguous. List keyword → skill mappings.

| Keyword / Intent | Skill |
|---|---|
| แก้ bug / fix / debug | editor |
| สร้างไฟล์ใหม่ / create / implement | coder |
| ย้าย / ลบ / rename file | file_manager |
| rename symbol / refactor export | variable_manager |
| จบ session / close / สรุป | session_manager |
| วางแผน / orchestrate multi-step | agent |
| token limit warning | token_auditor |
| review CFP / improve harness / self improve | self_improve |

## Default
No match → load `agent` skill (fallback to routing).

> **`mece` trigger priority** (highest → lowest): (1) Loop Phase 2 auto-run — fires ONCE per task; task boundary = Per-Turn skill change. Before overwriting `.sessions/mece_plan.md`, save existing plan to `.sessions/mece_plan_prev.md`. (2) Prefix before `editor` — when >1 file is affected by a fix. (3) Primary skill — when keywords like "implement/refactor" are the main intent. All three can apply; Phase 2 auto-run always supersedes.

## Micro-rules
- MECE plan required for tasks >3 steps or any irreversible action
- MECE plan sections MUST include `Skill:` field (editor|coder|file_manager|variable_manager|agent)
- token_auditor gates: >60k warn · >90k halt
- session_manager closes with 5 mandatory writes: Step 0 = self_improve CFP review FIRST → then session JSON + active_thread.md + session_tokens.md + session_handoff.md
- session_handoff.md must include: mece_plan_hash · cfp_boot_count · cfp_deferred · cfp_dismissed · last_self_improve_session
- On close: enumerate any `.sessions/cycle_N_*.json` files written this session in the confirmation reply
- Parallel sub-agent spawns: pre-assign T-IDs (I6) and CFP-IDs (I8) BEFORE spawning
- Cycle result files MUST include `tokens_estimated` field (I7)

## Learned Routes (auto-updated — fast match before skill lookup)

| Keyword/Pattern | Skill | Score | Uses | Last Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(auto-populated by session_manager after 3+ confirmed uses: pattern → skill)_ | | 4.0 | 0 | null |

## Scoring Rules
- Task success: score +0.1 (max 5.0)
- CFP logged or friction note written: score -0.5
- score < 2.5: route flagged unreliable → fallback to default skill (`editor`)
- Threshold: pending friction notes for same skill ≥ 2 → alert user before next task

## Trace Token Reference

All valid trace tokens agents must emit. Include in `CLAUDE.md` Quick Reference.

| Token | When to emit |
|---|---|
| `**[Boot]**` | First line of every session response |
| `**[pre-read]**` | Before every file read (index-first lookup) |
| `**[pre-edit]**` | Before editing any symbol — after used_in check |
| `**[gate]**` | Before any destructive action (I1) — wait for confirm |
| `**[db-gate]**` | Before any DB schema change (I2) — wait for confirm |
| `**[R8]**` | After file create/edit/delete — running symbol_indexer.py |
| `**[loop]**` | After each MECE section completes |
| `**[compact]**` | When SESSION_TOTAL > 50k — compact fires, continue working |
| `**[pause]**` | When SESSION_TOTAL > 60k — TOKEN PAUSE, save state, ask user |
| `**[resume]**` | When resuming an in_progress thread |
| `**[tokens]**` | Token checkpoint (A=before, B=after, C=final) |
| `**[MECE]**` | MECE plan sent to user — waiting confirm |
| `**[topic-switch]**` | New task = different topic → close session first → new Phase 1 |
| `**[topic-unclear]**` | Topic ambiguous → ask user before routing |
| `**[self-improve]**` | R16 complaint detected → backfill missed step |
| `**[cfp-tally]**` | New CFPs found at session close |
| `**[cfp-skip]**` | No new CFPs → skip CFP review |
| `**[cfp-deferred]**` | User skipped proposal → save count |
| `**[✓ harness-updated]**` | Harness file edited + verified by self_improve |
| `**[platform-unknown]**` | detected.md has platform: unknown → ask 4 questions |
| `**[plan-stale]**` | Resume + mece_plan_hash mismatch / src/ changed → ask reconfirm |
| `**[gather-stalled]**` | Phase 1 gather loop hit cap (3 iterations) → ask user |
